# ViciousSpiral Showcase

This repository contains selected C# scripts from my multiplayer Unity prototype “Vicious Spiral”.  
The goal of this showcase is to demonstrate clean code structure, gameplay system design,  
and problem-solving skills in a real project.

### What’s inside
- **Input-pattern recognition system**  
  Player draws a gesture by connecting UI nodes; the system detects the pattern and matches it to a spell.

- **Spell management system**  
  Dynamic spell storage, charges, VFX attaching, cooldowns, and mana checks.

- **Spell slot UI**  
  Runtime creation of spell slots, active slot switching, icons, highlights.

- **Player state controller**  
  Manages transitions between gameplay states (Normal, Casting, Menu, Dead) and controls movement, camera, and UI.

### Technologies
- Unity (C#)
- Photon PUN (multiplayer)
- Event-driven UI logic
- Object-oriented architecture

This repository includes only selected logic pieces, extracted and cleaned for clarity.
